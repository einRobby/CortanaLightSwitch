# Cortana Light Switch
This is a demo project I created for a workshop on a conference to show how to interact with Windows 10's personal assistant Cortana. It also connects with a home automation systems called HomeMatic and is able to switch a selected light on and off. Either by clicking a button or asking Cortana to do that.

## Technology
The demo app is written in C# and is based on the Unicersal Windows Platform (UWP) framework which allows to deploy apps across all Windows 10 devices including mobile phones and even the Xbox One.

To connect with the HomeMatic system I used my [Rhome](https://github.com/Thepagedot/Rhome) project which provides a C# SDK for several home automation solutions.
